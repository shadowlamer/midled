NeoPixel led strip controller, designed especially for led suits. It can:

 - display animation - sequences of frames at regular (given) interval,
 - switch animations on MIDI event - note on/off, velocity used for brightness adjust,
 - MIDI over UDP over WiFi (UDP broadcast so far, but i'm working on multicast),
 - use regular SD card to storage animations.

[These guys use them][1] for example. See videos on their page.
